"""
[TBD], my game that will include a decent amount of randomness and selection,
as well as novel encounters and maybe a loot system!
Why not, this could be a time to showcase some creativity and create some
interesting characters and interaction. I like games, games can be fun if you
put some thought into them so why not. I'll try to make a fun game.

# things to search for:
#- function or perameter to allow one char to be missing from string (if statement?)
#- random function types, what can i utilize here?

## + perhaps a vendor or beneficial stranger that appears quite seldomly and
## rewards the player
##
## + there's this black dude, right. so he's hanging out crouching japanese style
## and he's looking pretty solemn and you really don't feel like you could even
## be around him because his presence is so...BIG. but he's a medium sized dude,
## just muscley as heck. reminds me of raiden from mortal kombat.
##
## + dude named bonadio. actually means good day in italian so perhaps only when
## weather is right.
##
## + knowledgable cat character. obligatory feline race.



# Player Class, it can either contain the variable for a health system or health
# variable. Should have a gear and initial loadout method, as well as a function
# for equipping.

# Monster Class, can roll for species upon generation? Each species would have
# it's own attributes (attr)

# NPC Class, perhaps could incorporate disposition but that's a lot of coding.
# Boy I'm already getting ambitious. Could be a rewarding side project however
# and a good showcase of my potential work.



# Wherever you start, I want it to be revisited at some point, maybe a fountain
# whose liquid changes upon every encounter. Another thought was for this game
# to be loopable, either before or after resetting. Could have persistent items
# potentially.


# name gen function, no reason why not. hell i could attempt to scrub name
# databases based on user input if i wanted. i do need to get into that.


# one of the conditions for this game in the book is that this code must be
# self-contained, and in this case means all if must have else and air tight.
# so how can i best work with those constraints?
